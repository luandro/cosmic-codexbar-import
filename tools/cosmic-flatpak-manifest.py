"""Derive the cosmic-flatpak submission manifest from the local build manifest.

`flatpak/<app-id>.json` builds from a `dir` source so it can be built against
the working tree. The copy that lives in pop-os/cosmic-flatpak has to build from
a pinned commit in this repository instead, because their builder only has the
manifest, not a checkout.

Everything else - permissions, install commands, runtime versions - is copied
across untouched, so the local manifest stays the single place any of it is
edited and a release cannot quietly ship different `finish-args` than the ones
that were tested here.
