"""Re-vendor CodexBar's provider icons and regenerate the table in `src/icons.rs`.

The applet's data path is generic - it renders whatever providers the `codexbar`
CLI reports - but the brand icons are a snapshot of
`Sources/CodexBar/Resources/ProviderIcon-<slug>.svg` in steipete/CodexBar, so a
provider added upstream has no logo here until someone re-vendors. This script
is that someone: it syncs `data/icons/providers/` with upstream and rewrites the
`PROVIDER_ICONS` array so it stays sorted, which is what
`provider_icon`'s binary search depends on.

Run it with `just update-icons`; CI runs it weekly and opens a pull request.
Only the standard library is used, so there is nothing to install first.

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the API rate limit. It is optional: the listing is a
single request and the downloads come from raw.githubusercontent.com.
